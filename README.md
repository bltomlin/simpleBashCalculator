# simpleBashCalculator
A long time ago ancient people used fingers to calculate. Of course, this method had certain limitations. The abacus was invented to fill in the gap. Four hundred years ago, Wilhelm Schickard, a German astronomer, invented one of the first calculating machines. Another inventor, Thomas de Colmar, created Arithmometer in 1820. It was the first commercial calculator. We are very lucky, though. We got bash to do calculations. In this project, you will learn to create a simple calculator with bash.

## Description
    1. Start with a message Enter an arithmetic operation:

    2. Read two numbers and one operator on one line from the standard input;
  
    3. Check whether the numbers are numbers. Numbers could be positive, negative, or zeros;
   
    4. Check whether an operator is correct. Operators can be multiplication, division, addition, exponential and subtraction;
    
    5. If everything is correct, output the following message: "Operation check passed!" with the correct calculation. Otherwise, output Operation check failed!
    

## Examples
```
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

Example 1:

Enter an arithmetic operation:
> 5 + c
Operation check failed!

Example 2:

Enter an arithmetic operation:
> 22 / -7
-3.14

Example 3:

Enter an arithmetic operation:
> 5.4 / 2.8
1.92

Example 4:

Enter an arithmetic operation:
> 12 * -3
-36

Example 5:

Enter an arithmetic operation:
> 5 - -25
30

Example 6:

Enter an arithmetic operation:
> 2 ^ 3
8
```
